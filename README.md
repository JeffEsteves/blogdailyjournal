This is a fully responsive minimalist blog style website project based on Angela Yu's bootcamp on Udemy. Technologies applied in this project were Html, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, EJS templates. It was a good project to improve routing between pages and working with templates.
